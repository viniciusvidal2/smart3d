Generally, reconstruction can run pretty much with any computer with a NVIDIA graphics card running windows 64-bit. How well it runs is dependent on the complexity of your project. In order to run M.A.R.T. 3D just to visualize the results (to load all the project's cameras you may need a better GPU), your computer must meet the following minimum requirements:

If you want to use M.A.R.T. 3D to reconstruct your projects, your computer must meet the following minimum requirements (be aware that these RAM and VRAM requirements will vary with the quantity and resolution of the images of your project):
